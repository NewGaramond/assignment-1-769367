# Assignment guidelines

## Directory structure

* You should make sure that the top directory is named as "assignment_nr_studentid" by replacing "nr" with the assignment number and "studentid" with your student id.
* We have subdirectory:
   - *data*: for describing data. Do not put large dataset into this directory. You can put a small sample of data and/or indicate a public place where the data can be downloaded.
   - *code*: where you can put source code written by you (or source code modified by you)
   - *logs*: where you put logs generated from test programs or service logs that can be used to back up your report
   - *report*: where you put for reports about design, performance, etc.

## Content in the assignment

* No sensitive information should be stored in the assignment delivery (data, source, logs, reports)
* You must guarantee the data regulation w.r.t. all contents in the assignment delivery
* Only your student id should be stored in the delivery: the **submitter.csv** should have only a single line which is your student id.
